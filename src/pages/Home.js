        <ul>
          <li style={{'margin-top': "8px", "margin-bottom":"8px"}}>
            <strong>SQL Table Generators</strong> that convert your data into SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO TABLE statements. 
            Works for spreadsheet files (CSV, TSV, and excel), JSON files, and pasted tabular data.
          </li>
          <li style={{'margin-top': "8px", "margin-bottom":"8px"}}>
            <strong>SQL In-Clause Generator</strong> converts your data into WHERE or WHERE NOT statements so you can easily filter the data sets already in your warehouse.

        All operations are performed client-side so your data never leaves your computer.  Additionally, this is open source so feel free to clone the&nbsp;
